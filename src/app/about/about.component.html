        <p>Designing self-tracking products is far from straightforward, which is proven by current technology's pitfalls, such as dubious effectiveness and high attrition rates. The PSD Framework<sup>1</sup>, aims to aid HCI and self-tracking practitioners in this intricate design process by presenting 28 design principles for persuasive system content and functionality. However, PSD attaches the same weight to all 28 principles, ranging from self-monitoring to third-party endorsements. Some principles though, such as self-monitoring, reminders and personalization may bear higher importance than others in self-tracking technology. And here is where our tool comes in. We study 117 papers from the related literature and visualize their results in the Periodic Table of Self-Tracking Design (PAST), which enables self-tracking developers and HCI researchers to identify the most effective software and interface design elements for self-tracking technology based on previous interventions. This tool allows practitioners to experiment with our scoring function and adjust the PAST component to their applicationâ€™s needs.</p>
